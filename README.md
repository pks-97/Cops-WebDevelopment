Web Development Assignment for COPS(Club Of Programmers)
This is a simple implementation of web development task given by the club of programmers of IIT-BHU.
In this webapp there are a list of buttons and the first button is the only functional one. 
The other buttons have no function. If the user clicks the first button then the number of clicks displayed on the screen is increased.
However generaly in this kind of web app the user may spam the button and unnecessarily increase the traffic 
and will lead to a lot of problems hence to counter this i have used throttling in javascript,which does not allows
the user to click inbetween two seconds of the latest click.

Built With:- 1.HTML 2.CSS 3.Vanila JavaScript 4.Bootstrap.
